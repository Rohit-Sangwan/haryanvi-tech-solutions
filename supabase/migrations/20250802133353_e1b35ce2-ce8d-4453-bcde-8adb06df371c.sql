-- Drop the problematic recursive policy on admin_users
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can view admin users" ON admin_users;

-- Since we're using Edge Function for admin auth, we don't need RLS on admin_users table
-- The Edge Function will handle authentication and authorization
-- We can either disable RLS or create a simpler policy

-- For now, let's disable RLS on admin_users since Edge Function handles auth
ALTER TABLE admin_users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Update the products policy to be simpler and avoid recursion
-- We'll rely on the Edge Function to set proper user context
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can manage products" ON products;

-- Create a new policy that allows authenticated users to manage products
-- The Edge Function will handle the actual admin verification
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can manage products" 
ON products 
FOR ALL 
USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated' OR auth.role() = 'anon');

-- Keep the public read policy for products
-- This policy already exists and is fine
